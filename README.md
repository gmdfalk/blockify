# blockify
Blockify is a linux only application that allows you to automatically mute songs and advertisements in Spotify.  

**Blockify currently does not support Spotify version 1.0.0 and higher.** You can use a blacklist-based blocker like [spotify-blacklist-mute](github.com/ysangkok/spotify-blacklist-mute) instead.

## Installation
##### Dependencies
Before installing blockify, please make sure you have the appropriate dependencies installed.
- Mandatory: pygtk alsa-utils gstreamer0.10-python python2-wnck python2-dbus
- Optional (but highly recommended): pulseaudio python2-docopt  
- Installation tools: python2-pip (preferred) OR python2-setuptools  

Package names are for ArchLinux and will probably differ slightly between distributions. 

##### Automatic
Arch-Linux users can find blockify in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&K=blockify). You can choose between a stable version ([blockify](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/blockify/)) or the development version ([blockify-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/blockify-git/)).  

Example ArchLinux installation routine:  
``` bash
mkdir blockify
cd blockify
wget https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bl/blockify/PKGBUILD
makepkg
sudo pacman -U blockify-X.Y-Z-any.pkg.tar.xz
```

##### Direct (pip/setup.py)
If there is no blockify package available on your distribution, you'll have to install it directly via one of pythons many installation tools.  

First, the dependencies:  
``` bash
# Dependencies on Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-wnck python-gst0.10
# Dependencies on Fedora
sudo dnf install python-dbus gstreamer-python gnome-python2-libwnck
```
Then blockify itself:  
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/mikar/blockify
cd blockify
sudo pip install .
# Create optional desktop icon
echo -e '[Desktop Entry]\nName=Blockify\nComment=Blocks Spotify commercials\nExec=blockify-ui\nIcon='$(python -c 'import pkg_resources; print pkg_resources.resource_filename("blockify", "data/icon-red-512.png")')'\nType=Application\nCategories=AudioVideo' | sudo tee /usr/share/applications/blockify.desktop
```

## Usage
#### Requirements
It is important to know that blockify relies on dbus (and, for some features, on pulseaudio) for ad detection.  
If any of these statements are true for your configuration, ad detection will _not_ work:  
* DBus is disabled
* Spotify is minimized to the system tray (task bar is fine)
* Notifications are disabled in Spotify  

Additionally, blockify makes use of pulseaudio sinks, allowing processes to be muted individually.    
If you do not have/want pulseaudio, blockify will mute the system sound during commercials instead of just Spotify. The interlude music feature will not work as a consequence.

#### Detection
Blockify will automatically detect and block ads for you so besides starting it
after running spotify, there's not a lot to do.
However, it also comes with the option to complement or replace that autoblock functionality with a blocklist (saved as ~/.config/blockify/blocklist.txt).  
Blocklist-Entries are case-sensitive and greedy, e.g. the entry `Blood` would not only block all Bloodhound Gang songs but any song by any artist starting with `"Blood"`.  

#### Controls/Actions
Blockify accepts several signals:
* SIGINT(9)/SIGTERM(15): Exit cleanly.
* SIGUSR1(10): Block current song.
* SIGUSR2(12): Unblock current song.
* SIGRTMIN(34): Play previous spotify song.
* SIGRTMIN+1(35): Play next spotify song.
* SIGRTMIN+2(36): Toggle play/pause the current spotify song.
* SIGRTMIN+3(37): Toggle block state of current song.
* SIGRTMIN+10(44): Play previous interlude song.
* SIGRTMIN+11(45): Play next interlude song.
* SIGRTMIN+12(46): Toggle play/pause the current interlude song.
* SIGRTMIN+13(47): Toggle interlude autoresume.

Example usage:
```bash
pkill -USR1 -f "python2.*blockify"
pkill -RTMIN+1 -f "python2.*blockify"
```
Bind to keys for fun and profit.

##### CLI
Blockify has a CLI/daemon that you can start with `blockify`.  
`blockify -h` will print out a help text with available options.  

##### GUI
Alternatively, you can use the GUI with `blockify-ui` which spawns this window.  
![ScreenShot](http://a.pomf.se/bimbza.jpg)
- Play, Previous, Next: These buttons use dbus to send audio control commands to spotify.
- Block/Unblock: Add/Remove the currently playing song to/from the blocklist.
- Mute/Unmute: Mute/Unmute the current song. Only works if "Manual" checkbox is activated.
- Manual: Disables automatic mute of ads and instead allows you to mute manually.
- Show/Hide Cover: Enable/Disable display of cover art image.
- Autohide: If this option is checked, the cover art will be automatically hidden whenever a commercial is playing.
- Open/Close List: Opens a small popup text editor with the blocklist opened where you can edit and save it. Keybinds: Control-S (save), Control-W/Q (close), Control-D (delete current line).
- Exit: Stop blockify cleanly, i.e. unmute sinks, update blocklist and generally clean up.
- Enable/disable Player: Shows and enables resp. hides and disables the mini audio player (interlude player) below the button which will play music instead of commercials.
- Prev, Play/Pause, Next (bottom): Media buttons to control the interlude player.
- Browse: Allows you to open m3u-playlists and/or audio files on the fly. You can select multiple items and combine playlists with audio files. The player will automatically load those and discard the previous playlist.  
- Autoresume: If enabled, the interlude player will switch back to Spotify as soon as the commercials end. If disabled, the current interlude song will be finished before switching back to Spotify.  

##### Configuration
Please see the provided [example_blockify.ini](https://github.com/mikar/blockify/blob/master/blockify/data/example_blockify.ini) on what settings are available and their purpose.  
Blockify automatically creates a configuration file at `$HOME/.config/blockify/blockify.ini` if you don't have one already. It will also tell you via ERROR-logging messages, if you configuration file is faulty or incomplete, in which case the options that could be read will be merged with the default options you see in example_blockify.ini but you'll still want to fix your configuration file.  

##### Interlude Music
From version 1.4 onwards blockify can play music of your choice during commercial breaks.  
The default behaviour is for blockify to automatically play the first song in the playlist file (should you have one), when a commercial starts playing.  
Alternatively, you can set the autoresume option to False which will cause blockify to always finish the current interlude song before resuming spotify playback.   

The interlude feature only works if you use pulseaudio (i.e. spotify needs to run in its own sink so it can be muted separately).    
To make use of interlude music you have to configure a playlist file in `~/.config/blockify/playlist.m3u`.  
The playlist system is (mostly) M3U-compliant.  

An example playlist:
```
# Lines starting with "#" will be ignored.
# Absolute path to a file:
/media/music/foo/bar.mp3
# Relative path to a file (as seen from playlist location):
foo/bar.flac
# Relative path to another playlist. Just make sure the other playlist doesn't link back or else you'll get a very long playlist:
baz.m3u
# A whole directory:
/media/music/foo
# It's also possible to give full URIs:
file:///media/music/foo/bar.mp4
http://www.example.com/foo/bar.wav
# A radio station. Note that radio streams don't usually end so you'll have to switch
# back to spotify manually, enable autoresume or specify the radio_timeout in the config file.
http://skyserver5.skydisc.net:8000
```
You can use relative and absolute paths as well as basically any audio source/format, as long as you have the respective gstreamer codec installed.

## Troubleshooting
### Checklist
1. Do you have the newest version?
2. Is your configuration (and playlist) file syntax OK? If in doubt, delete it. It will be rewritten with default values.
3. Have you tried starting blockify in debug mode to look for useful information (i.e. `blockify -vvv`).

If you can't find or fix the error by yourself, you are welcome to open an issue on this site. When you do, please provide the following information:
- A debug log, acquired by starting blockify(-ui) via `blockify(-ui) -vvv -l logfile`. Then upload it with `curl -F "c=logfile" https://ptpbw.pw` or paste it to a gist or bpaste.net or directly into the git issue (preferably with code tags -> three backticks before and after the snippet).
- The blockify version: `blockify --version`.
- If you suspect pulseaudio as culprit, the list of sinks: `pacmd list-sink-inputs | curl -F c=@- https://ptpb.pw`.

Common errors:  
* `ImportError: No module named gst`: You need to install python-gst0.10.

Further guesses for why your blockify doesn't work:  
* Blockify has two binaries. `blockify` (CLI) and `blockify-ui` (GUI). Make sure you're using the right one.  
* If blockify doesn't find a Spotify process, it won't start.  
* If there's already a blockify process running, it won't start.  

## Known Issues
- Blockify currently does not support Spotify 1.0.0 and higher.
- If Spotify is minimized to the system tray, ad detection will not work.
- If DBus/Notifications are disabled, ad detection will not work.
